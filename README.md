# Rope weakening by knot

Calculate the degree of rope weakening by the some knots

**What is going on?**

Each rope has its own specific strength, for example, 10 mm wide polypropylene ropes have a strength of 16.9 kN, which means they can withstand a weight of about 1720 kg.

Every knot tied on this line weakens it to some extent - it's worth knowing how much.

If we tie a Bowline, our rope will only hold 878.8 kg.

To check the degree of use, two parameters should be given:

    $rope_strength = 16.9;         			// in kN
    $knot          = "Skrajny tatrzański";    	// string

Soon I will add more konts and their translations.

**Attention**
